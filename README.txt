The watchlist series accomplishes the following:
	1) Read a file generated by brokerage.
	2) Get current pricing data from finance api (Yahoo or Google).
	3) Generate an html table from file and api data.
	4) watchlist2.php and watchlist3.html updates all data via .js without page refresh.

watchlist1.php
	Uses PHP only and must be refreshed for current price and totals.

watchlist2.php (w/ watchlist2.js)
	Uses PHP to generate initial page with current values.  Uses watchlist2.js to update price and totals 
	without page refresh.  Uses ajax call for price updates.

watchlist3.html (w/ watchlist3.js)
	Uses JavaScript to generate initial page with current values, and handles all updates using a JSON ajax 
	call for current price info.
