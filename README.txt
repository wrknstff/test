The watchlist series accomplishes the following:
	1)	Read a custom file generated by brokerage.
	2)	Get current pricing data from finance api (Yahoo or Google).
	3)	Generate an html table from file and api data.
	4)	watchlist2.php and watchlist3.html update all data without 
			page refresh via ajax calls from .js resource.

watchlist1.php
	Uses PHP only and must be refreshed for current prices and totals.

watchlist2.php
	Uses PHP to generate the initial HTML page with current values from Yahoo Finance.  
	Uses watchlist2.js to update price and totals without a page refresh.  Uses JSON 
	call to Yahoo Finance for price updates.

watchlist3.html
	Uses the JQuery Ajax method to read the data file, and a jQuery JSON call to fetch the data 
	objects from Google Finance.  Table values are updated with current prices and totals 
	without a refresh.  All HTML is created and modified by directly accessing the Document 
	Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript and JQuery.
